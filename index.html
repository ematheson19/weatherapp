            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Evan, a college student majoring in Web Development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through my studies, I've primarily focused on front-end web development, gaining experience with HTML,
                CSS,
                and JavaScript. I completed courses in these technologies on FreeCodeCamp and have also finished my
                first
                semester in college with a focus on HTML and CSS. Additionally, I gained foundational knowledge in
                Python
                through an introductory programming class. I've always enjoyed problem-solving in web development and am
                eager to continue building my skills.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, my goal is to secure a front-end internship where I can apply my knowledge in a professional
                setting. For my first framework, I am going to learn React, and I'm excited to gain real-world
                experience
                working with it. In the long term, I aspire to work as a full-stack software engineer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ultimately, my dream is to become a remote full-stack web developer, as I have a passion for travel. Once
                I
                gain sufficient experience, I plan to transition into freelance or contract work.</p>
